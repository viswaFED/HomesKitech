Add powdered sugar, continue beating until the mixture is shiny and smooth.\nAdd the yolks and lemon juice and whisk until fully incorporated.\nMix flour and almonds and gradually add to the butter mixture. Mix until the doug has consistency of a thick paste. Do not overmix (too much mixing makes the cookies hard).\nAdd dried cranberries by kneading by hand.\nDivide the dough into two equal parts, shape each part into a 20-22 cm long roll.\nRoll each of the rolls in chopped almonds and/ or pistachios sprinkled over two aluminum sheets long enough to wrap the roll of dough. With fingers lightly press the roll towards the center to remove any air bubbles or cracks from the dough.\nWrap each roll in foil, twist the ends and place in the refrigerator for several hours, preferably overnight.\nRemove foil from a roll of dough (keep the other cool until use) and place on a cutting board. With a large, sharp knife cut the roll  into 5-6 mm wide slices.\nPlace the slices well apart, on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Bake the cookies in the oven preheated to 180C for about 12 min (be careful not to burn them). Let them cool on the sheet for about 5 minutes, then transfer to a rack or a plate to cool fully. Repeat with the second roll of dough.\nStore the cookies in an airtight container.",

Set aside 2 tablespoons of the spiced sugar to top the cake at the very end; add the rest to the butter. Cream together the butter, maple syrup, and two tbsp of the spiced sucanat with a mixer, scraping down the sides of the bowl, for about 3 minutes.</li><li>Add the eggs one at a time, and beat to incorporate each egg.</li><li>In a separate medium bowl, sift together the coconut, arrowroot, and almond flours, and the baking powder, and salt. Add half of the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and stir on low until just combined. Add the coconut cream and vanilla, and mix on low until just combined.  Finally,  add the remaining dry ingredients, mixing until just combined.  The mixture will be quite thick.</li><li>Now, cut the pears off of their cores. Slice up one cup of medium sized pear cubes, and cut the rest of the pears into 1/2 wedges.  Drizzle the lemon juice over the wedges to preserve them;  Fold the pear cubes into the batter and transfer the batter to the greased cake pan.</li><li>Take the pear wedges and fan them out around the cake, or create your own design if you like! Press them into the batter a little bit so that some of the batter comes through.  Sprinkle the leftover 2 tbsp spiced sugar over the top of the cake.</li><li>Bake the cake until a toothpick comes out just barely clean, about 35-50 minutes (Varies depending on the oven).</li><li>This cake is perfect with coffee, with breakfast, for afternoon snack, or for dessert!</li><li>Enjoy!</li></ol>",

Prepare the cupcake pans by greasing or placing paper liners in them.\nWhisk flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt together in a small bowl; set aside.\nIn a large bowl with an electric hand mixer on medium beat butter until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sugar gradually, beating until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping down bowl occasionally. Beat in Vanilla Extract. Beat in eggs one at a time. Beat in cooled chocolate.\nBeat in the flour mixture in 4 additions alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the flour mixture and beat briefly until smooth on low-medium.\nFill cupcake wells 3/4 of the way. Bake about 22 minutes or until a toothpick in middle shows a few moist crumbs.\nCool on wire racks ten minutes. Then remove cupcakes to racks to cool completely.\nTo make frosting: in a 2-quart saucepan melt butter over medium heat. Stir in brown sugar. Heat to boiling, stirring constantly, reduce heat to low.\nBoil and stir 2 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup Milk. Heat to boiling, remove from heat. Cool to lukewarm, about 30 minutes.\nPour the caramel into a large mixing bowl gradually stir in powdered sugar and milk. Beat with an electric hand mixer on low about 6 minutes until light and fluffy. If too stiff add milk a teaspoon at a time to get the right consistency. If too watery add additional powdered sugar beating on low until it reaches the right consistency.\nStore in refrigerator for 15 minutes before frosting to help it firm up.\nFor salted caramel sprinkle sea salt on top or mix a 1/2 teaspoon right into the frosting towards the end.",

(Be patient and don't be tempted to rush this stage).\nAdd the grated ginger, crushed garlic, fennel and cumin seeds (if using, if you are using cumin powder however, add in the next stage with the other ground spices). Cook for about 2 minutes until garlic and ginger are fragrant. Add ground coriander, turmeric, cayenne/chilli powder and salt. Cook for 30 seconds. Add the diced eggplant and stir well to coat evenly with spices. Pour in the tin of chopped tomatoes, give it a big stir, then place the lid on and continue to cook over low-medium heat for about 10-15 minutes. Check and stir a few times to ensure it's not catching on the bottom. Turn temperature down a little if need be.\nWhen the sauce has thicken and the eggplant is meltingly soft, check the seasoning once more. Serve sprinkled with coriander/cilantro leaves and steamed rice. Enjoy!",
